c is a procedural programming language that is 2 types of loops which are
1)pretest and 
2)post test loops

what are loops:
a loop is a block of code that alows us to do some task repeatedly untill a certain condition is met
1) Pretest loops:
this are loops that test the condition before executing the content of the loop examples are 
while loops
and for loops
2) Post test loops:
this are loops that test the condition after executing the content of the loop atleast once
example is
do while loop.
the do while loop allows us to execute the content of the loop atleast one beforechecking its condition
syntax of do while loop:
do
{
   //content of the loop
}while(condition);
